Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough analysis to understand the dataset and its features.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple classification algorithms, including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Logistic Regression
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 81.7% in classifying news headlines.
